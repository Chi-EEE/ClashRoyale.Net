Touchdown Arena = 18 x 32 

12.5 * 120 = 1500


18 : 32
x : 1500

18 * 1500 = 32x

27000 = 32x
843.75

tilemap (ALL ARE THE SAME):
35 width
63 height 

Therefore we should double the numbers we got from the math

3000 height
1,687.5 width

Lets double it once more to get rid of the decimal point

6000
3,375

With the wallbreaker reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/zp5hlb/this_game_bro_wtf/
We can see that the wall breaker has a sight range of 7 tiles or 7000 sight range
That means that each tile is 1000 sight range

Finally the arena is 18000 x 32000
and a tile on the tilemap is 500 px

And it takes [32000 / 12.5] seconds

D = S / T

S = D / T

S = 32000 / 12.5

D = 2,560 = 120
